# Lab introduction C

## Problem 1:

Write the program “Hello world” included, compile and execute it to learnt how to use the Linux and C environments.

## Problem 2:

Modify the previous program to read a name from the keyboard and print the name on the screen. 

For example, if said name is John, your program will display “Hello John”

## Problem 3:

Create a C program that declares an integer, a long int, and a float, assigns them a value, and prints them to the screen in different formats. 
Then read the two integers separated on the entry line by a space .

## Problem 4:

Write a C program that displays the parameters that a C process receives on the screen.

## Problem 5:

Write a program that takes two real numbers as input and prints their sum to 3 decimal places. 
To add them, a  function “add” must be declared that adds both numbers and returns the result.

## Problem 6:

Write a program that takes an integer as an input argument, declares a 10-element vector, initializes it with the argument, and adds the 10 elements of the vector using first for and then while. 
The results of both sums will be printed on the screen.

## Problem 7:

Modify the above program so that the sum of the 10 elements of the vector is done in a function.
The function will return the sum as a result, which will be printed on the screen.

## Problem 8:

Calculate the sum of two matrices and display it on the screen

## Problem 8:
a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

Write a c program to check whether a given number is a perfect number or not.

## Problem 9
Write a program that has a function with an integer parameter that returns 1 if the parameter is a prime number and 0 otherwise. The function will be used to indicate whether a number entered by keyboard is prime or not, and to write on the screen immediately afterwards the prime numbers between 1 and 1000.

## Problem 10

Define a recursive function called fibonacci that returns the indicated fibonacci series number.
